Form approach

the form will add up certain totals to get us to
the particular results we need the user to see. We have been basing our
data on numbeo data set which is at this link: https://www.numbeo.com/quality-of-life/region_rankings.jsp?title=2018-mid&region=021

was thinking the first 6 questions. The my enviorment questions would be used total the number we need to match the quality of life
column that will match the city we need to show. example if the first if my total matched or came closest to 191.52 then San Jose Ca would be
recommended as the city best for you.

The habit yes/no questions are then used to determine what products/marketing in that city that would fit thier life style.
example
if the do you learn something new everyday is marked yes then we can populate/recommend tutorials or local learning intrest.
if do you make positive connection regularly then you know that person is social so local bars and gathering spots can show up.
and so on.
